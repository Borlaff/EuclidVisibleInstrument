Weak Lensing Performance Calculator
===================================


SMN
systematic ellipticities e_s(x,y)
 - CTI: richard already worked on this
 - bias: needs a model
 - flat fielding: probably not systematic
 - non-linerarity:
-


SMN
2d power spectra C(l)
unit test: gaussian random field + known power spectrum, e-mode, b-mode=0, eb-mode=0 (andy's code)
outputs an ascii file


Tom
Fisher code, biases and errors
takes in an ascii file
C-code, call from python


SMN
plot the results
